##FEATURES:##
1. table-based, modular HTML email (will ultimately have only inline styles)
2. no media queries; width of 600px
3. placeholders for logos, social icons, and other images
4. use of rems and ems so that each module can be resized independently
5. thoroughly-documented, validated code
6. CSS fix for superscript HTML entities (&reg;) -- line-height distortion is anticipated, eliminated


##DIFFERENCES BETWEEN BUILD AND PSD:##
1. exact design ratios not possible:
  * Chrome does not support media queries, so compromises to layout had to be made
  * The original PSDs do not adhere to the convention of not exceeding a width of [approx.] 600px
2. button size increased in order to increase usability in small viewports
3. added underlined phone numbers that trigger the phone application, for increased usability
4. when the content of the "quad section" (the area with the gray background) exceeds a certain word-count, the 4 black squares no longer adhere to the desired design ratio.


##QUESTIONS:##
1. URL to hosted images? (social icons, etc)    { perhaps this is not our responsibility }
