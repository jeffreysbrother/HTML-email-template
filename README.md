##FEATURES:##
1. table-based, modular HTML email (will ultimately have only inline styles)
2. no media queries; width of 600px
3. placeholders for logos, social icons, and other images
4. use of rems and ems so that each module can be resized independently
5. thoroughly-documented, validated code


##DIFFERENCES BETWEEN BUILD AND PSD:##
1. exact design ratios not possible:
	 * Chrome does not support media queries, so compromises to layout had to be made
   * The original PSDs do not adhere to the convention of not exceeding a width of [approx.] 600px
3. button size increased in order to increase usability in small viewports
2. added underlined phone numbers that trigger the phone application, for increased usability


##QUESTIONS:##
1. URL to hosted images? (social icons, etc)    { perhaps this is not our responsibility }
