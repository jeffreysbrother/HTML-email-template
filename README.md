##FEATURES:##
1. table-based, modular HTML email (will ultimately have only inline styles)
2. no media queries; width of 600px
3. placeholders for logos, social icons, and other images
4. use of rems and ems so that each module can be resized independently
5. thoroughly-documented, validated code
6. added underlined phone numbers that trigger the phone application, for increased usability



##DIFFERENCES BETWEEN BUILD AND PSD:##
1. exact scaling not possible:
	a. Chrome does not support media queries, so compromises to layout had to be made.
	b. button size increased in order to increase usability in small viewports


##QUESTIONS:##
1. URL to hosted images? (social icons, etc)    { perhaps this is not our responsibility }
